# Hangman React Game

Hangman is a classic word game where the player must guess a word or phrase by guessing one letter at a time. For each incorrect guess, a body part is added to a hangman diagram. If the word is guessed correctly, the player wins.

This is a Hangman game built with React. It includes a pop-up that shows the game result and allows the player to play again. There is also an "About" button that opens an information modal with instructions on how to play the game.
